# Web-Vulnerability-Scanner ( SCANOFY TOOL)

* Created a Python-based network security assessment and vulnerability scanning tool, named 'SCANOFY.'

SCANOFY leverages a range of Python libraries, including socket, requests, pyfiglet, and SSL, to comprehensively analyze a target system's security posture.

First, SCANOFY conducts a thorough port scan, meticulously examining a range of ports to identify any open ports, providing valuable insights into potential points of entry.

Additionally, SCANOFY conducts header scanning, scrutinizing HTTP response headers for critical security-related information. This includes checks for the presence of crucial security headers such as 'X-Frame-Options,' 'Content-Security-Policy,' and 'Strict-Transport-Security.' Any missing headers can signify vulnerabilities, such as clickjacking, potential XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks, and SSL/TLS-related security issues.

Furthermore, SCANOFY performs robots.txt analysis to assess web crawling permissions, ensuring that critical sections of a website are appropriately protected from web crawlers and search engine indexing.

To round out its capabilities, SCANOFY conducts SSL certificate checks, monitoring the validity and expiration date of SSL, along with the TLS version on the target system. This feature ensures that websites maintain the highest standards of encryption and security.
